GITHUB RELEASE TODO:
 - remove shareware assets

TODO:
 - gamepad support? mfi
 - control via compass? see MagnetometerController in Watch-App-Sampler
 - use crown for changing weapons

 CANCELLED:
 - voice control - would be just a gimmick
    - cheetah is unusable, so current plan is to use speech recognition on iphone
        /Users/tomas/work/iOS_Playground/SpeechRecognitionPractice/SpeechRecognitionPractice.xcodeproj
    - but record on watch
        /Users/tomas/work/watchAVAudioRecorder/WatchAVAudioRecorder.xcodeproj
    
        watch <-> iphone communication: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27030296/watchkit-ios-sending-data-between-watch-and-iphone

DONE:
    - add shell script to download shareware assets
    - add origin links for a few snippets copied over from stackoverflow
    - add origin links for original Mac port
    - fix FPS cap and stats
    - add high pass filter:

    - try playing the guncock.wav file directly on device
    - solve memleaks crashes on (the higher the internal engine framebuffer resolution, the sooner it happens)
    - load the actual game (not just demo)
        - load command for loading of level ("e1m1") fails on network not being available, quake console commands: https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~portnoi/quake/quakecom.html#changelevel
            - it uses local device for network, but there is nothing in net_watch driver array, so i need to add something here
    - use crown for movement (down -> turn, up - forward)
    - to keep steady frametimes, wait if we are to soon to deliver next frame
    - siri control
    - clamp? audio sample? clamp(data[i], -1.0f, 1.0f);

    - synth ported to watch but no reso frequency found, sounds good so far,
    - next: try different shapes than sine wave
