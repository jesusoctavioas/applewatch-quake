Quake Apple Watch (qWatch) port made by me, Tomas MyOwnClone Vymazal, but I was really standing on the shoulders of giants, adding / changing fraction of code compared to original Id release and original open source Mac & iOS ports.
Major things this port does apart from existing Mac and iOS ports:
* this one is based on quake SW rasterizer, no Metal acceleration involved, I have written a simple blitter to copy internal quake framebuffer to WatchKit image surface
* controls adjusted for Apple Watch, touch, gyro and digital crown
* as WatchKit does not support CoreAudio, I could not use existing audio code in Mac and iOS ports and written custom AVFoundation audio backend (mainly buffer handling & copy code)
* Apple Watch has a speaker which does not like low freq "drone" sounds and portions of audio samples, so I have implemented ( really just copy-paste + ported high freq pass code from https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/73523/low-frequency-1hz-high-pass-filter ), otherwise real Watch device speaker would have a lot of clicking audio artefacts
* adding some stats display
* some small things to get all of the above running

codebases this port is either based on, some knowledge or snippets was used from them or served as an inspiration:

this port is largely based on:
https://github.com/Izhido/Quake_For_OSX
which is OFC based on original id software open source release

huge thanks to this guy, I have used a lot of knowledge (and possibly snippets) from his code
